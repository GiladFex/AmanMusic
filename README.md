2. build layout that fits all screen sizes.
3. integrate audio/video playing into the layout.
4. search works on any field of file
5. make shuffle work
6. make playlist works (playing + social)
7. append what currently hearing to last activity box
8. make home tab work similar to youtube main page -- suggested + recently played
