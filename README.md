Open Source Social Music Player

Hello!
This is an RTL Open Source music player.
I have't seen one that does a decent job so here I am. You're more than welcome to help with any knowledge you have!!

The API and code must be as tidy and readable as possible.

TASTKS:

* Sending forms to right DBs.

* Getting metadata from audiofiles

* Gesture+list in audiobar that there is a playlist. (num of songs playing can be achieved using textTracks.length

* smart search - by song name, singer, album or lyrics (if available).

* shortcuts:

	right/left - move song 10 seconds forward/backward.
	
	ctrl right/ctrl left - move to the previous/next song in playlist.
	
	up/down - change volume.
	
	space - stop/continue song.
	
	alt s - start typing in search.
	
	alt d - starred/remove star for the current played song.
	
	alt r - start shuffle.
	
	enter - start typing in chat box.

* unique hash url for playlists - and entering to the specific one if entered in url bar.

* Make html tags not affect chat.

* Sortable music lists

Thanks for reading and participating!
